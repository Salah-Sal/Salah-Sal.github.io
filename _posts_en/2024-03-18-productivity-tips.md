As developers, we're always looking for ways to improve our productivity. Here are my top 5 tips:

## 1. Use Keyboard Shortcuts
Learning keyboard shortcuts can save hours of work time. Some essential ones:
- `Ctrl + C`: Copy
- `Ctrl + V`: Paste
- `Ctrl + Z`: Undo

## 2. Pomodoro Technique
Break your work into 25-minute focused sessions.

## 3. Code Documentation
Always document your code as you write it.

## 4. Regular Breaks
Take short breaks to maintain mental freshness.

## 5. Task Prioritization
Use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks.
